# Koder — a personal kanban PWA with an agent-friendly backend

A kanban board (Projects / Life tabs) built as a Progressive Web App with **zero
dependencies and no build step** — every PWA and sync mechanism is hand-written
and commented so you can read exactly how it works. The board syncs to a tiny
free server, and AI agents can file tickets onto it from any terminal.

```
you (browser)  ──sync──▶  Deno Deploy API + KV  ◀──POST /tickets──  agents / CLI
     ▲                        (source of truth)
localStorage cache
(instant paint, offline)
```

## Quick start

Service workers require **https or localhost** (not `file://`), so serve the
folder with any static server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Open the printed URL (usually http://localhost:3000). That's it — with no sync
config the app runs purely on localStorage.

To enable sync, copy `js/config.example.js` to `js/config.local.js`
(gitignored) and fill in your server URL + token — see
[server/README.md](server/README.md) for deploying the server in ~5 minutes.

## Repo tour

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The app shell — one page, no templates |
| `js/app.js` | The entire app: rendering, drag & drop, PWA glue, sync |
| `css/styles.css` | All styling |
| `sw.js` | Service worker — offline caching + update flow |
| `manifest.webmanifest` | Makes the app installable |
| `js/projects.json` | Generated project list (don't edit by hand) |
| `js/config.local.js` | Your sync server URL + token (gitignored) |
| `server/main.ts` | The whole backend: 3 endpoints, Deno KV |
| `scripts/gen-projects.sh` | Regenerates `projects.json` from folders in `Code/` |
| `scripts/koder-ticket.sh` | CLI: add a ticket from any terminal |
| `skills/koder-ticket/` | Claude Code skill so agents can use the CLI |

## How it works

**One state object, one render function.** `state` holds the whole board;
`render()` rebuilds the DOM from it. Every interaction is
`mutate state → save() → render()`. Projects aren't configured anywhere — each
folder under `Code/` *is* a project (run `./scripts/gen-projects.sh` after
adding/removing one).

**Offline-first, server-canonical.** `save()` writes localStorage synchronously
(instant, works offline) and schedules a debounced push to the server, which
holds the canonical copy as one `{ rev, board }` document in Deno KV. The app
pulls on tab focus and every 30s.

**Conflicts: optimistic concurrency.** Every push states the revision it was
based on (`baseRev`); the server rejects stale writes with a 409. The client
then merges — local edits win card-by-card, but server cards it has never seen
(agent-added tickets) are kept — and retries. A persisted dirty flag plus a
`pagehide` beacon means edits made right before closing the tab aren't lost.

**Agents add tickets without knowing the board.** `POST /tickets` does the
read-modify-write server-side and assigns the id, so a one-line shell command
is enough:

```bash
./scripts/koder-ticket.sh "Fix login bug" --project holitrackr --column todo --priority high
```

Install the skill so Claude Code sessions in *any* repo can do this when you
say "add a ticket to my board":

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -r skills/koder-ticket ~/.claude/skills/
```

## The PWA pieces (and where to read them)

1. **Web App Manifest** — `manifest.webmanifest`. App name, icons,
   `display: standalone` so it opens without browser chrome when installed.
2. **Service Worker** — `sw.js`. Pre-caches the app shell on install, serves it
   cache-first (offline boot); `projects.json` and `config.local.js` are
   network-first because they change out-of-band. Read the lifecycle comments:
   install → activate → fetch.
3. **Registration + install UX** — top of `js/app.js`. Version-update "Reload"
   toast, custom Install button via `beforeinstallprompt`. The SW is disabled
   on localhost so development never fights stale caches.

## Things to try

- **Install it**: Chrome/Edge show an "Install app" button in the header.
- **Go offline**: DevTools → Network → "Offline", reload — shell from the SW
  cache, tickets from localStorage.
- **Ship an update**: change something visible, bump `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js`,
  reload twice — you'll get the update toast.
- **Race yourself**: add a ticket via the CLI while dragging cards in the tab —
  watch the 409/merge path reconcile both (Network tab shows it).

## Development notes

- Local server for the API: `cd server && KODER_TOKEN=dev deno task dev`, then
  point `js/config.local.js` at `http://localhost:8000`.
- The sync token ships to the browser (static site — nothing client-side is
  secret). Treat it as low-stakes: unguessable, rotatable, CORS-lockable via
  `KODER_ORIGIN`. See the security note in `server/README.md`.
- Commit checklist: `js/config.local.js` and `scripts/.koder.env` must never
  appear in `git status` (they're gitignored).

## Stretch goals (roughly in order of learning value)

- Host the frontend itself (second Deno Deploy app in static mode) so the board
  works from any device, not just this machine
- Migrate ticket storage from localStorage to **IndexedDB** (async, larger
  quota, accessible from the service worker)
- **Background Sync** — queue pushes in the SW so they survive tab closes
  better than the `pagehide` beacon
- **Push notifications** for ticket due dates (server exists now — needs
  Notification permission + a trigger)
- **Share Target** — let other apps "share to" the board to create tickets
- Real per-user auth, if the board ever goes multi-user
